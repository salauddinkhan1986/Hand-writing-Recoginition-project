# Hand-writing-Recoginition-project

Section I.I : Initial EDA
Explore the datasets descriptive statistics.
Create graphs of the counts of each class
Make deductions upon the class distribution
Section II : Data Preparation
Normalize the pixel value of the all images
Section III : Model Construction
Create a baseline model
Train the model
Section IV : Model Evaluation
It is recommeded to to use Kfolds to evaluate your model, what other validation process could you employ ?
What would be the best value for K and why for this baseline model
Evaluate the model accordingly and make a note of it's performance with respect to it's accuracy
Section V : Model Evaluation Metrics
Create Graphical plots of the model performance on the train and test set during individual folds.
Section VI : Improving your models
Section VII : Improve the depth
